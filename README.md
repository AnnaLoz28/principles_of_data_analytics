# Principles of Data Analytics

by Anna Lozenko


## **Aim of the Module**

1. Source and investigate sets of data.

2. Programmatically explore and visualize data.

3. Apply basic mathematical data analysis techniques to data sets. 

4. Model real-world problems for analysis by computer.

5. Provide evidence in a decision-making process using a data set.

6. Appreciate the limitations of graphical representations in data intensive workflows.

## **Tasks - Iris Dataset Analysis**

The Iris dataset was created in 1936 by the British statistician and biologist Ronald Fisher. It consists of measurments of 150 Iris flowers from 3 species, with 50 samples per species:

- *Iris setosa*

- *Iris versicolor*

- *Iris virginica*


The dataset contains data on 4 important features, used to describe the physical characteristics of the Iris flowers:

1. Sepal length (cm)

2. Sepal width (cm)

3. Petal length (cm)

4. Petal width (cm)

The Iris dataset is widely used today in statistics and machine learning. It is a valuable resource for learning and practicing data analysis techniques due to its simplicity.
